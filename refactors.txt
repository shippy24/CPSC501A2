REFACTORING 
Moved work initially done in inspect into seperate methods.

Changed name of findMethods to traverseMethods -> makes more sense.

Added comments which make sense and make it easier to follow.

Joined similar work done at different places into a method so we don't repeat code.

Structured code in a way that features are easier to add, for instance once I had done method declarations for interfaces and super classes it became
simple to do the constructors, exceptions, fields and so on.
